# Wave-Cafe
recreated a website designed by Tooplate, using only HTML5 and CSS3.

This project was incredibly fun to do! 
I did a mobile-first approach.

I learned about applying video backgrounds to webpages, I also got more practice with CSS grid which was awesome for me.

Likewise, I continued to see the importance of being able to create responsive webpages and I'm slowly starting to figure out ways to improve responsiveness in the sites I build.

I look forward to learning more about responsive webdesign and figuring out new techniques to make the process easier/simpler. 

You can check out the final result here:
